## METACRAFTERS ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course

## MODULE: Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX

### Task Description

For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix.

From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.


### USAGE
- Find the contract under the src folder
- Head to [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), paste the contract and deploy.
- Feel free to play around with the contract.
